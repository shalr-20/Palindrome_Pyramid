# **Palindrome Pyramid**

This is a Java program that generates a Palindrome Pyramid. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121, 343, 12321 are palindromes. And, a Palindrome Pyramid is a pyramid pattern where each row contains a palindrome sequence of numbers. 

## **Features**

**Takes input:** Users can provide number of rows as input.

**Output:** Users will get a palindrome pyramid of the "input" number of rows.

## **Limitations**
* The program expects a positive integer as input for the number of rows.
* If an invalid input is provided, such as a non-integer value or a negative number, the program will terminate with an error message.
